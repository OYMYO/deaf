To replicate a working model of the application a user would need to have the programme run 
- a voice recording
- audio sent to be automatically changed to text
- text and audio delivered to recipicant

to achieve this easily with existing products would be to have a voice chat application installed on each device along with the dictation app

to do this we could use a PTT app and embed a browser in the background to load a service like dictation.io, which will translate everybodies voice into text

this method is better than plan 1 because it would involve no central server & little admin & also will not have the few seconds TTL delay that the OBS method would.

the data would have to be compressed and dumped onto a server to clear cache etc 

this model would be able to support advertising for revenue as the app is free, or users can pay for extra functions such as radar which would be a model that wouldnt have to run ads
