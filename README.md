# deaf
A social app for people &amp; people with friends whom are hearing impaired.
the app will transcribe the calls & conversations in realtime into text

the app needs to work as a "one click" to open
- create apk. 
(i have started with the apk from zello 3.12 for android 1.5 and up)

(currently this all works as a standalone service however to clone the setup I will start with learning how to create an app)
my plan is to embed a very lowbit live video stream ontop of the zello app which will show the transcribed text.

this works by having the zello channel, play through a transcriber & live stream the text back to the deaf.

multiple people can talk at the same time, the app will listen & dictate each one individually, chronologically, with options to skip, replay & reply etc.

the app is prone to malfunction if the que of messages is more than the time to consume them so an option to "jump back to real-time" is essential, which will reset all missed messages.
