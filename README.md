A social app for people &amp; people with friends whom are hearing impaired.
the app will transcribe the calls & conversations in realtime into text

the app needs to work as a "one click" to open
to do 
- create apk. 
(i have started with the apk from zello 3.12 for android 1.5 and up)

(currently this all works as a standalone service however to clone the setup I will start with learning how to create an app)
my plan is to embed a very lowbit live video stream ontop of the zello app which will show the transcribed text.
